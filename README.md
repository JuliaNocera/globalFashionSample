# FashionLy 
- a sample MEAN stack app for a coding exercise 

The task : 
	Build a fashion discovery platform. Start off with a working product mock, using a Pinterest-like board layout, feeding off a RESTful API backend delivering JSON data via AJAX calls, and using infinite scroll to add content to the page as the user scrolls down.

This was a great opportunity to play around with grid formatting and building a RESTful API backend.
